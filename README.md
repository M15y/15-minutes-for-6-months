# 15 minutes for 6 months
_For SaaS and consumer startups. Take 15 minutes to set up an issue tracking system you wonâ€™t have to think about for 6 months._

[![Memorable Milestones](https://res.cloudinary.com/m15y/image/upload/v1588977044/su/TJ5G67VHU/kmbjqinsp71vavcdth7j.svg)](https://github.com/instantish/memorable-milestones)

## Setup

Add the files from the `.github` folder into your repo's `.github` folder. Or, if you don't have a repo yet, you can clone this one and start from there!

That's it!

## What does this do?

This will trigger actions that put your labels and milestones on auto-pilot.

The milestones are weekly sprints, created 7-8 weeks out, and due every Thursday. The GitHub Action will create them ahead of time and close them when they're done.

Labels are a simple set of tags meant for private projects. Colors and names are determined to be memorable and simple.
