_How to set up a minimal issue tracking process in 15 minutes that you wonâ€™t have to think about for 6 months._

Step 1: Add the files from the `.github` folder into your repo's `.github` folder. Or, if you don't have a repo yet, you can clone this one and start from there!

This will trigger actions that put your labels and milestones on auto-pilot.

The milestones are weekly sprints, created 7-8 weeks out, and due every Thursday. Labels are a simple set of tags meant for private projects. Colors and names are determined to be memorable and simple.
