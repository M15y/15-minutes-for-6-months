# 15 minutes for 6 months

_For early-stage SaaS and consumer startups._

[![Memorable Milestones](https://res.cloudinary.com/m15y/image/upload/v1588977044/su/TJ5G67VHU/kmbjqinsp71vavcdth7j.svg)](https://github.com/instantish/memorable-milestones)

Take **15 minutes** to set up a basic issue tracking system (labels + milestones) you probably won‚Äôt have to think about for at least **6 months.**

## Get started

1. Click the green "Use this template" button.

2. To trigger the GitHub Action for the first time, edit the `name` field in `.github/workflows/milestones.yml` to be `"Use weekly Memorable Milestones"`. A small commit triggers the milestone syncing.

That's it! ‚ö°Ô∏è

_Want to use the labels and milestones for an **existing repository?** Copy over the `.github/workflows/milestones.yml` file and add the labels to your repository manually (we wish there was a faster way too! üê¢)._

## What does this do?

This will trigger actions that put your labels and milestones on auto-pilot.

The **milestones** are weekly sprints, created 7-8 weeks out, and due every Thursday. The GitHub Action will create them ahead of time and close them when they're done. [Read the methodology.](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/memorable-milestones)

The **labels** are a simple set of tags meant for private projects. Colors and names are determined to be memorable, simple, and accessible. Inspired by [this research paper](https://t.co/Th3xuoC02R?amp=1) on colour theory.
